Hello! Thank you for download this asset.

In "Animations" folder you can find all animations for this character. You acn use that for creating you own animation controller, but at the same time you can use controllers from "Controllers" folder. There you will find a few different controllers - each of them created for character with different weapons. If you like this, check how it work in demo scene. You can find demo scene in "Demo" folder. Pay attention for "PlayerController" script.

"rightGunBone" and "leftGunBone" (Transform) - this is two bones for inserting weapons in them.

"arsenal" (Arsenal[]) - array which contain all animation controllers and weapon prefabs. First element of this array using by default.

"Arsenal.name" (string) - this is just name of Arsenals object for convenience.

"Arsenal.rightGun" and "Arsenals.leftGun" (GameObject) - prefabs for left and right weapons. That fields can be empty.

"controller" (RuntimeAnimatorController) - animation controller for character with these guns.
